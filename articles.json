One time, for example, I was planning a road trip and it gave me an amazing destination I was really excited to go to only to find out it\u2019s been closed for years when I looked into booking accommodations.\nThis phenomenon of AI generating false or misleading information is called Hallucinations. The biggest problem with this is that the AI doesn\u2019t tell you when it\u2019s telling the truth or not. It\u2019s just as confident hallucinating as it is telling legitimate real-world information.
