One time, for example, I was planning a road trip and it gave me an amazing destination I was really excited to go to only to find out it\u2019s been closed for years when I looked into booking accommodations.\nThis phenomenon of AI generating false or misleading information is called Hallucinations. The biggest problem with this is that the AI doesn\u2019t tell you when it\u2019s telling the truth or not. It\u2019s just as confident hallucinating as it is telling legitimate real-world information.

    "content": "Building an AI-powered Poem Generator in Swift\nBefore Large Language Models (LLMs) became so widely used in the outbreak ChatGPT product, they were actually tested as super powerful completion machines. Based on just a simple prompt such as \u201cAnd the cow jumped over the moon\u201d for example, the LLM could complete it into a full original poem following in the pattern of the famous \"Hey, diddle, diddle,\" nursery rhyme by Mother Goose. It achieves this by generating the next most likely word (or \"token\" to be more precise) based on all the training data it has processed, which can be as vast as the entire internet.\nHowever, the LLM\u2019s standalone completion functionality by itself was not found as usable in that state. Instead, OpenAI trained a new model (a brilliant move, in retrospect) with the help of thousands of overseas human workers to apply the completion functionality of the LLM in a User-Assistant conversation format. This chat interface became the breakout product of LLMs.\nKnowing t",

These methods often assume that simulators accurately represent the true data-generating process, but in practice, this assumption is frequently violated. Such discrepancies can result in observed data that are out-of-distribution relative to the simulations, leading to biased posterior distributions and unreliable inferences. This blog reviews recent work on model misspecification in SBI, discussing its definitions, methods for detection and mitigation, and open challenges. The aim is to emphasize the importance of developing robust SBI methods that can accommodate the complexities of real-world applications.",
